**Model description **
----------------------
The word embedding model for superalloy corpus was pre-trained on ~9000 unlabeled full-text superalloy articles by Word2Vec continuous bag of words (CBOW) in genism, which use information about the co-occurrences of words by assigning high-dimensional vectors (embeddings) to words in a text corpus, to preserve their syntactic and semantic relationships.
