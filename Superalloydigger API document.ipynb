       "'Keyword Co-Al-W-base alloy Tensile behavior Dislocation structures Stacking fault 1 Introduction Nickel-base superalloys , possessing exceptional mechanical properties due to the well known strengthening of γ′ type γ′ precipitates , are widely used for manufacturing aircraft and power-generation engine turbines . Recently , Co-base superalloys strengthened by γ′ ( γ′ ) with γ′ structure have gained substantial interest . A series of experimental [ 1-7 ] and computational [ 8,9 ] efforts have been done to study the effects of alloying elements on the microstructure and mechanical property of the new Co-base alloys , suggesting that γ′ has some similarities with that of Ni3Al and can be practically used as the strengthening phase of Co-base superalloys . However , in the Co-Al-W-base alloys , large amount of W is added to stabilize γ′ , leading to a high density . The γ′ solvus temperature is relatively lower compared with that of Ni-base superalloys , a big restriction on high temperature applications . Efforts have been dedicated to improve the two-phase γ/γ′ microstructural stability at elevated temperature . Ta is effective to improve the γ′ solvus temperature in ternary Co-Al-W system [ 3,4 ] . The γ′ solvus temperature of Co-9Al-8W-2Ta-2Cr ( at % ) alloy is above 1050°C which is slightly lower than that of Co-9Al-8W-2Ta ( at % ) alloy [ 3 ] , while the γ′ solvus temperature of Co-7.8Al-7.8W-2Ta-4.5Cr ( at % ) alloy is only 960°C [ 4 ] . In a Co-7.5Al-7W-x Cr ( x =13 , 17 , 21 , at % ) alloy system [ 5 ] , the γ′ solvus temperature is decreasing as the Cr content increasing . It seems that the addition of Cr makes against the improvement of γ′ solvus temperature . With 8 at % Cr additions , the oxidation resistance of this new type Co-base superalloys is approaching the level of MAR-M 509 at 800°C [ 6 ] . Recent investigations by Shinagawa et al . [ 7 ] indicate that substitution of Ni for W can stabilize the γ′ phase and slightly increase the γ′ solvus temperature , which is beneficial to decrease the density . Besides , a combined addition of Cr and Ni to ternary Co-Al-W system can improve the γ′ solvus temperature [ 5 ] . It can be seen that the combination of alloying elements greatly affects the γ′ solvus temperature of Co-Al-W-base alloys . It is interesting to know the effect of a combined addition of Ni , Cr and Ta on the microstructure and property of Co-Al-W alloy system . Thus , in the present study , a Co-Al-W-Ni-Cr-Ta alloy system is tentatively designed , whose tungsten amount is merely half of those reported Co-base alloys [ 3,4 ] , and attentions are paid to the microstructure and tensile properties of the alloy and characterizing the main deformation microstructures with the aim of comparison to those of Co-base alloys containing high amount of tungsten . 2 Experimental procedure The nominal composition ( at % ) of the alloy studied is as follows : Al~10 , W 5 , Ni~17 , Cr 6 , Ta 2.7 , balance by Co ( named as 5W ) . The master alloy was melted in a vacuum induction furnace , and then directionally solidified into [ 001 ] single crystal rods by Bridgman technique at a constant withdraw rate of 6 mm/min . The melting point and γ′ solvus temperature of the alloy were determined by Differential Thermal Analysis ( DTA ) under high purity Ar atmosphere with a heating rate of 10°C/min . The heat treatments were carried out as follows : 1310°C/10°C h , furnace cooling+1000°C/36 h , air cooling+750°C/24 h , air cooling . Heat-treated samples were polished in a solution of 42 ml H3PO4 +34 ml H2SO4 +24 ml H2O at 10 V.The microstructure was analyzed using a Scanning Electron Microscope ( SEM ) . The volume fraction and size distribution of γ′ precipitates were analyzed by image analyzer . Tensile specimens with a nominal 35 mm gage length and a diameter of 5 mm were machined from heat-treated samples . Tensile tests were conducted at a strain rate of 1×10−4 s−1 from room temperature to 1000°C with the crystal growth direction parallel to the tension loading direction . During the test , the temperature variation was maintained within ±2°C . At least two identical specimens were tested at each temperature . AJMS-6301F field-emission scanning electron microscope ( SEM ) was used to observe the fractures . Transverse sections of the fractured specimens were cut into discs with 0.5 mm in thickness . These discs were polished to 50 μm , and then subjected to twin-jet polishing in a solution of methanol with 5 vol % perchloric acid at −30°C and 18-20 V.A JEM~2100 Transmission Electron Microscope ( TEM ) was used for dislocations analysis . 3 Results 3.1 Microstructures The transformation temperatures measured by DTA are given in Table 1 . For comparison , the transformation temperatures of other Co-base superalloys with γ/γ′ microstructure and the Ni-base superalloy CMSX-4 are also given in Table 1 . It can be seen that the solidus and liquidus of Co-base superalloys are higher than those of Ni-base superalloys . This suggests that there is a possibility for greater temperature capability compared to Ni-base alloys . However , the γ′ solvus temperature of Co-base alloys is still much lower than that of Ni-base superalloy CMSX-4 . By comparing Co-9Al-9W ( at % ) alloy and Co-7.3Al-6.8W ( at % ) alloy , the γ′ solvus temperature is decreased from 985°C to 854°C , indicating a lower W content depresses the stability of γ′ . With large amount of Ni additions , the γ′ solvus temperature increases slightly . As mentioned earlier , alloying with certain amount of Cr will result in the decrease of γ′ solvus temperature . Possessing a higher amount of W and Ta , the γ′ solvus temperature of Co-7.8Al-7.8W-4.5Cr-2Ta ( at % ) alloy is lower than that of Co-9.9Al-4.8W-1.8Ta ( at % ) alloy , probably associated with the addition of Cr . Thus , simple substitution of Ni for W or alloying with certain amount of Cr in Co-Al-W-Ta alloy system is not valid to improve the γ′ solvus temperature . The~5W alloy exhibits a relative higher γ′ solvus temperature and lower density compared with those of Co-8.8Al-9.8W-2Ta ( at % ) alloy , suggesting that alloying with high Ni and high Ta can overwhelm negative Cr effect as well as the negative low W effect . The SEM micrographs and frequency size distribution of γ′ precipitates of the heat-treated sample are shown in fig  1 . The~5W alloy is only constituted of γ and γ′ phases . The γ′ precipitates exhibit cuboidal morphology , aligned along the 〈100〉 direction , which is similar to that of the typical Ni-base superalloys . It is possible to note that the size distribution is close to a Gaussian distribution ( fig  1 b ) . The average size of γ′ precipitates is about 310 nm . Based on the results of image analyzer , the γ′ volume fraction of the alloy is about 65% . 3.2 Tensile behavior fig  2 shows true stress-strain curves of the alloy tested at different temperatures . Crystal orientations of four single-crystal bars used in the present study are about 5° , 6° , 3° , 8° away from [ 001 ] , respectively . It can be seen that the alloy exhibits different tensile behavior over the experimental temperature ranges . That is at room temperature , a strong strain hardening phenomenon is observed . With the increase of temperature , the degree of strain hardening becomes weak . The partial enlargement of A in the tensile curve tested at room temperature is shown in the top-right corner , in which serrations are observed . Serrations are also observed at the initial stage after yielding up to 800°C . Such similar phenomenon is also observed in several Ni-base single-crystal superalloys [ 11 ] , which is due to a difficult dislocation generation step in the γ matrix and then an easy propagation step in an octahedral slip plane . So far , the authors have studied the effect of microstructures , strain rate and temperature on the serrations . The occurrence of serrations observed in the present study will be discussed in another paper . It seems that the curve tested at 900°C exhibits two elastic stages . It is not an accidental phenomenon , which is also observed in the other two specimens tested in same conditions . The partial enlargement of the kinking region in the 900°C curve is shown in the lower right corner . Some small serrations can be observed , while serrations are hardly observed beyond the region . It is not clear whether the serrations are associated with the kinking . Further work needs to be done to clarify the uncommon phenomenon . The 0.2% yield strength as a function of temperature is plotted in fig  3 . For comparison , those of PWA1480 single crystal superalloy [ 12 ] , Mar-M509 superalloy [ 13 ] and two γ′-strengthened Co-base superalloys [ 4 ] are also included . It can be seen that the strength of γ′-strengthened Co-base superalloys is higher than that of a conventional Co-base superalloy Mar-M509 . At high temperature , the yield strength of γ′-strengthened Co-base superalloys is even comparable to that of PWA1480 at a similar strain rate of 8.33×10−5 s−1 above 871°C [ 12 ] , so the Co-base alloy system has a great potential for high-temperature structural applications above 900°C . However the intermediate-temperature strength of γ′-strengthened Co-base superalloys is still inferior to that of Ni-base superalloys . For Ni-base superalloys , the deformation mechanism below peak temperature is well accepted that γ′ precipitates are cut by a/2〈110〉 dislocations on octahedral slip forming an antiphase boundary ( APB ) . Analogously , in Co-base superalloys , γ′ precipitates are cut by a/2〈110〉 dislocations on octahedral as well as cubic slip from 600°C to the peak temperature [ 4 ] . In the single phase γ′ alloys [ 14 ] , extensive APB-coupled dislocations are observed below the peak temperature . The associated APB energy , γ APB , represents a barrier which must be overcome if cutting of particle occurs , and the precipitate-cutting stress is expected to be in the order γ APB /b , where b is the Burgers vector . Thus , for γ′-strengthened Co-base superalloys the strength can be enhanced by alloying elements that increase the APB energy . In view of inadequate understanding of the alloying effect on APB energy , availability of a thermodynamic database would provide useful guidance in identifying the key alloying elements . Similar to another two Co-base alloys in fig  3 , the 5W alloy exhibits a three-stage temperature dependence of the stress . In the low temperature range ( below 600°C ) , the strength decreases with increasing temperature . In intermediate temperature range an anomalous behavior is found which peaks at around 800°C . In the high temperature range ( above 800°C ) , the strength decreases again . At room temperature , the yield strength of 5W alloy is lower than that of Co-8.8Al-9.8W-2Ta ( at % ) alloy . With temperature increasing , the 5W alloy and Co-8.8Al-9.8W-2Ta ( at % ) possess similar strength up to 700°C . Nevertheless , above the peak temperature , the strength of the 5W alloy is inferior to that of Co-8.8Al-9.8W-2Ta ( at % ) , exhibiting a slightly rapid decrease in strength . Compared with Co-9.4Al-10.7W ( at % ) , the 5W alloy exhibits an higher yield strength during the testing temperature range . This suggests that despite of alloying with a small quantity of tungsten the strength still possesses superior strength with Ni and Ta additions . 3.3 Fracture surfaces fig  4 shows the fractures of specimens tested at room temperature , 700°C and 1000°C . Below the peak temperature , the samples exhibit similar fracture characteristics . At room temperature and at 700°C , fractures are wedge-shaped , and cross sections exhibit elliptical shape , indicating a predominance of a single 〈110〉 { 111 } type slip system . Less river patterns and cleavage ledges are observed in the fracture surfaces . The dimple morphology shown in fig  4 b and d confirms that the specimens fractured in a ductile mode under tension . At 1000°C , the fracture surface is cavernous . Many pores as well as facets can be observed in fig  4 f. At higher temperature and lower strain rate , the movement of dislocations as well as pores formed during solidification can lead to the coalescence of micropores . The continuous coalescence of micropores can result in the spread of microcracks and the occurrence of facets . The spread of microcracks will result in the formation of large cracks , which can contribute to the fracture rapidly . It can be inferred that the specimen tested at 1000°C fractured in such mode . 3.4 Dislocation structures 3.4.1 Low temperature regime ( 20-600°C ) fig  5 shows the deformation microstructures of 5W alloy tested at room temperature . Three SF configurations are observed in the γ′ precipitates or in γ channels , which are SFs extending from the γ/γ′ interface to γ′ precipitates , SF loops within γ′ and SFs in γ matrix . It can be seen that there are more SFs in the γ channels of the [ 010 ] direction than those in the [ 100 ] direction , which means the [ 010 ] and [ 100 ] channels are under different stress states . The maldistribution of SFs between [ 010 ] channels and [ 100 ] channels in tensile specimens tested at room temperature was also observed in a single-crystal Ni-base superalloy , which was attributed to the deviation of crystal orientation from the ideal [ 001 ] [ 15 ] . A similar dislocation activity in parallel or vertical channels is also observed in Co-9Al-9W-0.1B ( at % ) alloy after creep tested at 850°C [ 16 ] . Their view on such behavior is based on Nabarro׳s predictions [ 17 ] that in the first stage of creep the dislocation activity is contained in one family of matrix channels either parallel ( vertical ) or perpendicular ( horizontal ) to the external applied stress and the preferred channel is dependent on the mode of creep deformation either compressive or tensile and the sign of the lattice mismatch between the phases γ and γ′ . The tensile test is a transient deformation process , much similar with the primary stage of creep . Thus , the two conditions mentioned above may result in the different local stress states in both orientations of matrix channels . SFs crossings and interactions with dislocations in the γ channel are expected to be effective impediments to gliding dislocations on different planes . It can be deduced that the strong strain hardening phenomenon observed at room temperature is related to the occurrence of SFs in the γ channel . High density of SFs extending the entire γ′ phase is frequently observed . In contrast to the single , isolated SFs shearing the entire γ′ particles , fault loops are occasionally observed within γ′ , as shown in fig  5 . The formation of three SF configurations will be discussed in Section 4.2 . The deformation microstructures observed at 300°C ( shown in fig  6 ) are similar to those observations at room temperature . SFs in γ′ precipitates and fault loops are also observed . 3.4.2 Intermediate temperature regime ( 600-800°C ) fig  7 demonstrates the deformation microstructures at 600°C , 700°C and 800°C , which correspond to temperatures below , near-peak and at the peak stress . At 600°C ( fig  7 a ) , SFs are also observed both in γ′ precipitates and γ channels . Some straight dislocations in the γ′ precipitates are observed as well ( marked by dark arrows ) , indicating the shearing mechanism . In the single-crystal Co-8.8Al-9.8W-2Ta ( at % ) and Co-9.4Al-10.7W ( at % ) alloys after compression at same temperature , pairs of a/2〈110〉-type dislocations that sheared into γ′ precipitates were frequently observed [ 4 ] . Since the a/2〈110〉 dislocation in the γ′ precipitate can dissociate into a/3〈121〉 dislocation and a/6〈112〉 Shockley dislocation accompanying with SFs , the SFs observed in present alloy can be also formed in such way . From the true stress-strain curve at 600°C , obviously work hardening can be observed . SFs in the γ channels may partially contribute to the work hardening . At 700°C ( fig  7 b ) , a typical feature is dislocations shearing into γ′ precipitates . These dislocations ( marked by white arrows ) lie in the [ 010 ] direction , and TEM analysis demonstrates that these dislocations are the a/3〈121〉-type dislocations lying in the { 111 } plane in the γ′ precipitate while at two beam conditions SFs are invisible . The dislocations ( marked by single white arrow in fig  7 b and d ) slip in different directions within same γ′ precipitate , indicating a possibility which is the cross slip of the superdislocations from the octahedral plane to the cube plane . SFs in γ′ precipitates and fault loops are also observed . What interests us more is the occurrence of fault loops within γ′ precipitates at high temperature , which are generally observed in low temperature range . We will give the explanation on the abnormal appearance of fault loops in Section 4.2 . fig  7 c shows general features of the dislocation substructures observed in the 5W alloy after deformation in tension at peak temperature . High density of SFs in the γ′ phase without extension across the γ channel is commonly observed . The density of SFs at 800°C is higher than that at 700°C and 600°C ( fig  7 a and b ) . In the single-crystal alloys Co-8.8Al-9.8W-2Ta ( at % ) and Co-9.4Al-10.7W ( at % ) [ 4 ] , the deformation occurs initially by shearing of the γ′ precipitates by a/2〈110〉 superpartial dislocations that enter as pairs of dislocations from the γ phase at 800°C . Since the a/2〈l10〉 partials can dissociate at the γ/γ′ interface or in the γ′ precipitates , yielding a superlattice intrinsic stacking fault ( SISF ) , it is difficult to confirm which one takes place during the experiment . The SFs ( projected on the ( 001 ) plane ) extending along mutually perpendicular directions in the same γ′ precipitate are also observed , suggesting that dislocations with different slip systems are activated . In the γ channel lots of entangled dislocations and only few SFs can be seen , while strong interaction of SFs within γ′ precipitates can be seen , probably associated with the work hardening exhibited in the true stress-strain curve . Fault loops are still observed within some γ′ precipitates ( marked by dark arrows in fig  7 c ) . 3.4.3 High temperature regime ( 900-1000°C ) The dislocation configuration at 900°C is shown in fig  8 . A high density of SFs is observed in the γ′ precipitates , similar to the observations in single-crystal alloy Co-8.8Al-9.8W-2Ta ( at % ) at 890°C [ 4 ] , indicating a similar dissociation mechanism . Thus , the SFs are likely to be generated by the reaction of dislocations at the γ/γ′ interfaces to form partial dislocations and gliding of the partial dislocations across the γ′ precipitates . However , the major deformation mechanism in the alloy Co-9.4Al-10.7W ( at % ) is bypassing of the precipitates by unpaired a/2〈110〉 dislocations above 800°C [ 4 ] . In the alloys Co-9.4Al-10.7W ( at % ) and Co-8.8Al-9.8W-2Ta ( at % ) , the variation of deformation mechanisms above the peak temperature is associated with the SISF energy of γ′ impacted by Ta additions . The applied stress that enables the a/3〈112〉 partial dislocations to shear into γ′ precipitates is affected by the SISF energy of γ′ , a higher SISF energy requiring a higher applied stress and resulting in the increment of strength [ 9 ] . Ta is believed to increase the SISF energy of γ′ . Around 900°C , the yield strength of 5W alloy is higher than that of Co-9.4Al-10.7W ( at % ) and lower than that of Co-8.8Al-9.8W-2Ta ( at % ) , probably resulting from the refractory-element solid-solution-hardening and the variation in the SISF energy of γ′ . fig  9 shows the configuration of the dislocations after tensile test at 1000°C . In comparison with the γ′ precipitates sheared by dislocations below 900°C , deformation at higher temperatures is mainly via bypassing of γ′ particles by dislocations , which is similar to observations in alloy Co-9.4Al-10.7W ( at % ) above 900°C . Interrupted tensile test results from Milligan et al . indicate that the first step in deformation was bypassing of the γ′ particles , which was followed by shearing of the γ′ particles later during tension [ 18 ] . SFs are observed in γ′ precipitates , indicating the shearing mechanism . Thus , this suggests that the deformation mechanism in the present alloy at 1000°C is very similar . Compared with Ni-base superalloys , γ/γ′ interface dislocation networks are hardly observed , probably due to the large positive lattice mismatch , resulting in the rapid decrease in yield strength . 4 Discussion 4.1 The yield strength anomaly As shown in fig  3 , from room temperature to 600°C , the yield strength decreases with increasing temperature , and then the yield stress abnormally increases with temperature up to 800°C , and finally the yield stress decreases rapidly above 800°C . In the γ′ compound γ′ , the yield strength exhibits a near-plateau from room temperature to 677°C and an anomalous increase between 677 and 827°C [ 14 ] , which is analogous to the observations in the present alloy . It is generally understood that the anomalous temperature dependence of the yield strength in γ′ compounds is caused by pinning of cross-slipped screw segments of superdislocations from the octahedral { 111 } plane to the cube { 100 } plane , which is driven by elastic anisotropy and/or lower APB energy on { 001 } planes . It is reported [ 14 ] that the elastic anisotropy factor of γ′ is larger than that of Ni3Al by 5-10% and the ratio of APB energy on { 111 } planes and { 001 } planes is 1.42 at 700°C which compares well with those observed for many other γ′ compounds . In view of the yield strength anomaly as well as observations in fig  7 d , it can be inferred that the similar strengthening mechanism exists in the present study . 4.2 Temperature dependence of SFs formation With respect to Ni-base superalloys , the deformation mechanism in tensile tests consists of : ( i ) shearing of γ′ precipitates by pairs of a/2〈110〉dislocations on { 111 } planes in low temperatures range ( 20-760°C ) , ( ii ) shearing of γ′ precipitates by the 〈112〉 { 111 } slip system at intermediate temperatures ( around 760°C ) , and ( iii ) bypassing followed by shearing of the γ′ precipitates at high temperatures ( above 800°C ) . SFs are commonly observed at intermediate-temperatures deformations . A typical reaction might then be [ 19 ] : ( 1 ) a / 2 〈 011 〉 + a / 2 〈 1 ¯ 01 〉 → a / 6 〈 1 ¯ 12 〉 + a / 3 〈 1 ¯ 12 〉 + SF in γ ′ If the applied stress is sufficient , then the a/3〈1 ¯ 12〉 dislocation is able to enter the γ′ precipitate leaving a SISF behind it , and the a/6〈1 ¯ 12〉 remains at the γ/γ′ interface , relaxing the coherent stresses . However , in the present alloy 5W , SFs are observed either in γ′ precipitates or in γ channel with various configurations in a wide temperature range after deformation . SFs in γ′ precipitate are commonly observed at 800°C and 900°C , which can be observed in Ni-base superalloys at lower temperature during tension . In a Ta-doped γ′-strengthened Co-base superalloys [ 4 ] , high density of SFs that originate from dislocation segments on the γ/γ′ interfaces are observed at 890°C after compression test , which are also formed by the way of Eq . ( 1 ) . In the present alloy , SFs observed at high temperature are probably generated in a similar way . In a Ru-containing single-crystal Ni-base superalloys [ 15 ] , SFs appear in both γ′ precipitates and γ channels after tensile testing at room temperature , which is attributed to a lower SF energy . As for conventional Co-base superalloys , owning a lower SF energy , dislocations frequently dissociate into Shockley partial dislocations bounding SFs even without deformation [ 20 ] . Therefore , the formation of SFs in the γ channel is probable due to its lower SF energy . It is interesting to note that fault loops are observed both at low and high temperature . These defects are commonly observed in many alloys such as PWA~1480 [ 21 ] and ( Co , Ni ) 3Ti [ 22 ] after deformation in the low temperature range . A possible formation way is given [ 21 ] : ( 2 ) a 〈 1 ¯ 01 〉 → a / 3 〈 1 ¯ 1 ¯ 2 〉 + a / 3 〈 2 ¯ 11 〉 + SF in γ ′ In the compression test of γ′ at low temperature range ( from −196°C to 300°C ) , fault loops were continually observed , and the TEM analysis suggested these were formed by Eq . ( 2 ) [ 14 ] as well . A series of experiments [ 23-25 ] indicates that the SISF can be switched from the APB . Assuming that the total energy of an unit a〈011〉 dislocation dissociation into two partial a/2〈011〉 dislocations coupled by APB and Eq . ( 2 ) is E 1 and E 2 , respectively , then whether this transition happens or not depends on the relative magnitude of total energies E 1 and E 2 of the two dissociation schemes . The criterion for the transition from APB to SISF is given in Ref . [ 24 ] as follows : ( 3 ) If γ APB γ SISF ＞2.49 ( d 1 b ) 3 / 7 cos 2 ( β ) + 1.3 ( d 1 b ) 22 / 203 sin 2 ( β ) , then E 2＜ E 1 , where d 1 is the equilibrium spacing of the component partials in these two schemes , b is the magnitudes of the Burgers vector of the component partials , β is the angle between the burgers vector and the dislocation line . Thus , it can be inferred that large ratio of APB energy and SFE results in the formation of fault loops at room temperature . In single phase γ′ , the size and density of the faulted dipoles decrease with the increasing deformation temperature up to 300°C , where the faulted dipoles disappear [ 14 ] . This suggests that the ratio of APB energy and SFE decrease with temperature . However , at 700°C and 800°C , fault loops are still observed . The~5W alloy is more complex alloying and certain solute atoms may segregate to defects . The experimental [ 26 ] and computational [ 27 ] results have proved that the SFE can be reduced by the segregation of solute atoms ( i.e . Suzuki segregation ) . The simulation results [ 27 ] revealed that Cr segregated at SFs and Nb additions enhanced the Cr segregation significantly in a single phase Co-base alloy , which resulted in a further decrease of SFE . Thus , there is a possibility that the SFE of sites which solute atoms segregate to is decreased and the small ratio of APB energy and SFE leads to the formation of fault loops . So far , it is not clear which element segregates at SFs and which element can enhance or decrease the SFE of γ′ phase in Co-Al-W-base alloys . Thus , further work needs to be done to clarify the elements segregation behavior at SFs and its effect on SFE . 5°Conclusion The microstructures of the single-crystal Co-Al-W-base superalloy have been characterized by TEM after tensile tests at different temperatures . The deformation mechanisms under different test conditions have been analyzed . The following conclusions can be drawn : ( 1 ) Alloying is an effective way to improve the mechanical properties of the new generation Co-base superalloys . With the great reduction of tungsten amount , the alloy still possesses higher γ′ solvus temperature and yield strength by additions of Ta and Ni . ( 2 ) From room temperature to 900°C , the deformation mechanism is the shearing of γ particles by dislocations . At 1000°C , the deformation mechanism is the bypassing of γ′ particles by dislocations followed by shearing of γ′ particles . The anomalous yield behavior above 600°C can be attributed to the paired 1/2〈110〉 dislocation slip on both octahedral and cube planes in the γ′ precipitates . ( 3 ) Fault loops are observed both at low and high temperature . At low temperature , the occurrence of fault loops is associated with the relative high ratio of APB energy and SFE . At high temperature , one possibility of the formation fault loops is that a lower SFE caused by Suzuki segregation results in the relative high ratio of APB energy and SFE .
