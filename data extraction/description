Starting with a corpus of scientific articles scraped in XML (Extensible Markup Language), HTML (Hyper Text Mark-up Language) or plain text format, NLP techniques are used to preprocess the raw archived corpus to produce a complete document record and filter out irrelevant information. Text classification aims to determine which sentence contains the target property information to be extracted. Table parsing transforms complete table caption and body into structural format and then classifies which table contains the chemical composition and target property information to be extracted. NER technology recognizes alloy named entity, property specifier, and property value from English-language text and table, followed by relation extraction. Relation extraction of text and table give the specific tuple relations for concrete element content and property, and dependency parsing resolves the linkage to chemical composition and property data fragments for one specific material. Finally, the extracted tuple entities containing article DOI, alloy named entity, chemical element, content, property specifier and property value are automatically compiled into a highly structured format for materials database.
The code in table_extractor folder is used for extracting information in tables from literatures.
The code in text_extractor folder is used for extracting information in sentences from literatures.
The code in text&table extractor folder is used for extracting information in sentences and tables from literatures together.
The code in pipeline folder directly realize the transformation from literature to structured database.
